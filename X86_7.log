MOOOOREEEE SEEEEEMMMMMm YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I know its been a while but I been struggling with config the compiler
Local Lables:
    | . | usually Identify the local scope
    You can reuse the label names as long as it doesnt cause a conflict

Relative Addressing:
    lea rsi, [code + rax]:
        this is an example of relative addressing
        [] these denote indirect addressing:
            the address is written in here
            mov rsi, rax - copies rax into rsi
            mov rsi, [rax]- copies memory content(8 Sequential bytes):
                the reason we know this is copies 8 bytes is bc mov copies,
                everything to a tee. if rsi is 8bytes then mov will copy 8bytes

    mov and lea have a slight diffrence:
        lea means load effective address
