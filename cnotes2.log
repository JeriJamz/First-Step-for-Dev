Cnotes 2:
so'\n' is how yo make a newline#oddly familiar to python
printf takes one two functions:
    format string(the string values), formatt specification(%d):
        when it comes to format specification i think it gets replaced by the value of a variable
            and this %d can take on more that one argument apparently
/**/ is how to make a multiline #ngl need to add this everytime i make a lingo
#----Variables-----
vars are simple so far kinda like a weird js and python mix
    cant forget to add the variables to the end of the declration line?
when a program has a variable that use and integer you need the 'int' in the declareation statment #like in var.c the int a, b, sum;
    all variables must be declared before you write and use the actual program
character sets in program languges are called tokens
so C uses something called ass-key(ASCII, American Standard Code for Information Interchange )
# use the regular American keyboard 
    Also use something called the control character.
        backspace, tab, line feed, form feed, and carriage return# im in danger
think of code as a nothing but groups of tokens and delimiters
    far as the machine is concern the only thing that is important is the order of the tokens and delimiters(layout is more for the people)
        unlike python you dont have to use one line for one statement
        you can write one statement over multi lines as long as you end the statment with a semicolon
        spaces also are all that important. only error example i can think of is putting a space btw number(23 -> 2 3)
#not gone talk about all the tokens
Identifies:
    user Identifies are are names the programmers made for things like variables, symbolic constants, function names
        It can start with an underscore or letter 
            cant start with a digit but can be included
