#*While I am thinking about it. I been wondering. Can I put arguments with the naming constants?

    #the book open my eyes to something. Required repition logic --> while loops
    import WhileLoops_skel()

        endwhile
    exit()
    if the first value is the condition that terminates the program,
    the program not really gone start
