pick up where i left off. I was learning that you can immediatly call the 64 - bit register in ASM 
    apparently it doesnt operate in the highest bit register(show a lil more light on the hardware stack)
so you have to call out certain registers/ oh and some of these have no gen purpose so u can get creative:
    i hear a register dedicated for MTG strats
    I.E r8 in this ex()
#time to break this down for a better understanding
the mov rbx, 0ffh:
    init the RDX reg(which is cycle storage/ so can you also put numbers here instead of the RAX)
    #*Small rant*#
    #*I kno w/ RCX and RDX i can basically make a clock and run clock spd
    yada yada but can i also store number and have it where it cycle and store number
    actually now i think about it, why tf wouldnt
    also i think you can bitcoin mine hella effieciently with ASM*#
its followed by an or operand(or rdx, 80000000h):#yo glad to kno there operand in asm, we can have fun
    this does sum magic im read about later,
    that operand turns 0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFFF8000000
now that isnt the final result/ gotta make it into a 64 bit value
mov r8, 80000000h loads a 84 bit int(0x0000000080000000000)#its that crazy reg dialect
#so mov might only be a 64 bit operand 
the mov operand make sure or rdx, r8 instruction yields the expected value

    ~~~SiDE NotES(insert the meme)~~~
    books gives me hella sides notes
    in 32 bit if you us a number this size you gotta split it up:
        ie a jmp or call function.
        now you got about 2+-GB to work with:
            it aint alot once you account the internert, video game, porn, photo, then bidness stuff
            then actual computer stuff
        there are function that can help with getting outside that window
            #but ill nerd out later
*#

#*
    actually important side note 
    another diffrence is how output is effected
    when using manipulated 32 bit reg in a 64 bit platform
    the high order 32 bit are zeroed so you can use the for Arithmeticinstructions

#now i want a 32 bit book
