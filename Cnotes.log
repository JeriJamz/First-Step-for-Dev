C Notes(100!!!):
 machine lingo is 1 and 0, If i get it right C is one of the first higher lvl lingos
 {} this is called the body of the function
 declaration statment: are line " int a, s" 
'//' this is how to make a comment in C
 You have to put the ; at the end of a line to indicate that it is over with
 apparently for a computer to run code. it has to loaded in the memory(primary storage)
 why i think c doesn't have a Class orentied system
 My favorite! data types:
    float-point-number are called real numbers(deciamals), names are another, integers are whole numbers
    numeric refers to numbers
    string refers to non-numeric data
    Constants:
        so for one character constant is delimited by single  qoutes and double qoutes for string
        if i get this right Constant turn a variable into a inmmutable data structure like a dictionary in python
    Characters:
        # this is gonna be fun
        simple run down:(
        digits from 0-9, An uppercase or lowercase letter(A-Z), special symbol,) 
#side note there are statments!!!
The statment:
    (not a comment)#include <stdio.h> is called a compiler directive# this provides the infomations the compiler need to compiler your program
    the instructions for input/output instructions are provided by the standard functions
    any C program that uses the input/output(printf) must inform the compiler to 'include' the declaration in the files stdio.h(the compiler will shit itself it you dont)
The C programs consists of more than one functions(or subprograms):
    main is one:
        the () this necessary in C. it helps the programs understand what is going on and also just incase it needs an arguement
    the int before main let C know which type of value to return back
    the body part of the function is where the actual code is written:
        {} indicates the body:
            one or more statments are called a block or compund statment
