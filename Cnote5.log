Cnotes5:
I see why certain Principles(not laws) came from C:
    Reading the section on if\else and while loops is eye opening
import if\else.skel():
    if (<condition>) statement;
        else(<condition>) statement;
#for blocks use this formatt
    if (<condition>){
        statement
    }
        else(<condition>){
            statement
        }
#semicolon doesnt happen until your done with each statement
#do it inside the {Curly Brackets;} not outside
#again for each statement
exit()
*Program Testing:
    This is mainly about debugging#My Favorite humbling experince
    when program testing you need to try out every variable:
        get random at points bc people are random, life is random and computers dont know how to handle it
        plus you just might be plain wrong#we all are
        Test the threshold of your code:
            if you written a limit or threshold test,
            your code at the threshold to see how it will handle it and,
            what the output it
        Most time it came to debugging. it more of grammatical(syntax) error,
        than an actual functionality problems#Unlike my coding lingo. That Shit Broke.
    Also it helps just to write the code write the first time but were human,
    after 50 lines were gonna mess up also other tools help like:
        Utube, Google and Documentations
Symbolic/manifest/named Constant:
    #*When I talk trash about Java and Js this what i mean, Java is C Son that tries his hardest
    Const sucks in Js. C grandson(python) got it right with class*#
    A variable that wont change#helps with thousands of lines of code
