Guide on General Purpose Registers 

name    Alias   Description

r0      rax     sort of a accumulator used in Arithmeticinstructions. for example
                div is used to divide two ints. it accepts on operand and uses rax as
                the second one. after that rcx(r1) a big 128-bit number(gotta break that up)\
                rdx(r2) and rax(r0) is divide by rcx(r1) and stored in rax(r0)

r3      rbx     Base register. Was used for base addressing in early processor models

r1      rcx     Used for cycles(can keep time in a way)(like loops)

r2      rdx     stores data during input/output cycles

r4      rsp     Stores the address to the topmost element in the hardware stack

r5      rbp     stacks frame base(gonna talk about later)

r6      rsi     Source index in string manipulation commands(movsd)

r7      rdi     Destination index in string manipulation command(movsd)

r8      N/A     N/A 

r9-r15  No       Appeard later(Prolly round the same time 32-bit was a thing). used to store temporal variables
                 (but sometimes used implicity like, r10, which saves a spu flag when syscall instruction is executed )
