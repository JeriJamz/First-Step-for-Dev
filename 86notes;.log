X-86 the deep-end:
# fun fact 32-bit is single percision floating points, 64 is for double
(1)Fundamental Data Types:
The power of two is a really good priniple to remember(gone dbl up(32-64-128))
data types are numbered right to left(idk like binary 001(being read one, zero,zero))
the least significant byre is stored in the lowest memory Byte
    this type of storage(inmemory) is called endian
